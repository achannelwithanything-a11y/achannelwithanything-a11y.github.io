<p><strong>Stress</strong></p>
<p>Stress is the body's response to pressure or challenges. Too much stress can make someone feel tired, irritable, or unable to concentrate, but learning healthy coping strategies can help manage it.</p>

<p><strong>Panic Attacks</strong></p>

<p><strong>Social Anxiety</strong></p>

<p><strong>ADHD</strong></p>

<p><strong>OCD</strong></p>
<p>OCD is a condition where someone has unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and feels the need to repeat certain actions (compulsions) — like checking things or washing their hands — to feel less anxious.</p>

<p><strong>Eating Disorders</strong></p>
<p>Eating disorders are conditions where someone has an unhealthy relationship with food or their body image. This can include eating too little, too much, or feeling strong stress about food or their appearance.</p>

<p><strong>PTSD</strong></p>
<p>PTSD is a condition that can develop after experiencing something scary or traumatic. People with PTSD might have nightmares, feel on edge, or avoid reminders of what happened.</p>

<p><strong>Bipolar Disorder</strong></p>
<p>Bipolar disorder is a condition where someone's mood changes between very high energy (mania) and very low energy or sadness (depression). These shifts can affect daily life and emotions.</p>
